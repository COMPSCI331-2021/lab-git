#Git Branch
In this lab exercise, we will demonstrate how branch can be created on Git. Three developers namely dev1, dev2 and dev3 must add three separate features on the Counter sample.  

## Feature 1 by Dev1 
implement the increment method **incrementToEven()** that increases the counter to the next even number. implement the decrement method **decrementToEven()** that decrease the counter the previous even number.

## Feature 2 by Dev2
implement the increment method **incrementToPrime()** that increases the counter to the next prime number. implement the decrement method **decrementToPrime()** that decrease the counter the previous prime number.

## Feature 3 by Dev3
implement the **countFrequency()** method. This method count the number of word in the given sentence. Also, you must refactor the code implemented by dev1 and dev2. The code refactoring should improve the overall quality of source code such as getting rid of replicate code, apply the standard code convention, etc.

Your team must work on these features on three separately branches namely feature1, feature2 and feature3 before merging them into the master branch. The following steps guide you on the overall process of this development.

<ol>
  <li>Dev1,2,3 - clone the project to local repository using Eclipse</li>
  <li>Dev1,2,3 - implement feature 1,2 and 3 respectively on their own local source code</li>
  <li>Dev1 - stage, commit and push your changes on feature1 branch</li>
  <li>Dev2 - stage, commit and push your changes on feature2 branch</li>
  <li>Dev3 - stage, commit and push your changes on feature3 branch</li>
  <li>Dev1,2,3 - create a pull request to merge from their own branch to the master branch</li>
  <li>team leader approves the pull requests</li>
</ol>
