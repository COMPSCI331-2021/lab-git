<h1>Basic Git</h2>
You must perform three tasks to make changes on the repository. After you finish each task, please commit and push your changes (you MUST write a meaningful commit message to explain the changes committed) on the master branch. Here is the steps of performing these three tasks by group of three developers: Dev1, Dev2 and Dev3.
<ol>
  <li>Dev1,2,3 - clone the project to IDE</li>
  <li>Dev1,2,3 - performs task 1,2 and 3 seperately</li>
  <li>Dev1 - stage, commit and push your changes for task 1</li>
  <li>Dev2 - fetch, pull to sync changes, then stage, commit and push your changes for task 2</li>
  <li>Dev3 - fetch, pull to sync changes, then stage, commit and push your changes for task 3</li>
</ol>
